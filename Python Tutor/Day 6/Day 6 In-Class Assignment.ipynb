Next, we are going to do something a little more abstract to seek correlations in the data, a standard goal in data science. As you have seen, there are a lot of fluctuations in the data - what do they tell us? For example, do the levels go up at certain times of year? In certain years that had more rain? Can we see evidence of global warming? While we won't answer these questions at this point, we can look for patterns across the lakes to see if the fluctations in levels might correspond to trends. To do this, we will plot the level of one lake versus the level of another lake. Note that we somewhat lose the time information because we aren't using that array anymore. \n",
