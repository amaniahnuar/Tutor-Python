    "### A brief aside on Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "Before you get started with this notebook, take a few minutes to make sure you are feeling comfortable with **Jupyter notebooks** at this point in the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "* It is really important to keep in mind that Jupyter notebooks are based on cells. This is a markdown cell, for example. Because you can execute the cells in any order you wish, *it is up to you to keep track of what has been done, or not*. If it helps, you can make an initial habit of running all cells from the top down, although there will be cases where you won't want to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "* It is worth taking a few minutes to get better at keyboard shortcuts, which will make using the notebooks much more efficient; and, learning some markdown is also helpful. Both are in this [webpage](https://murillogroupmsu.com/introduction-to-jupyter-notebooks/), and you can also do a web search to find other tutorials on these topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the best things about the notebooks is **rapid prototyping of code**. This means: try something quickly, delete it and move on. With the keyboard shortcuts, this becomes quite fast. Suppose you want to know what \"4 + 5 * 3\" will give. The steps are simple: create a new cell, type that expression in, shift-enter, examine the result, delete that cell, use the result. If you learn the keyboard shortcuts, this prototyping/debugging is fast:\n",
    "    * press \"esc\" to get out of the cell you are in (go into command mode)\n",
    "    * press \"b\" to create a cell below (or \"a\" for above - your choice)\n",
    "    * press \"return\" to enter/activate the cell (go into edit mode)\n",
    "    * type in your test (e.g., 4 + 5 * 3 or print(5//3))\n",
    "    * press \"shift-enter\"\n",
    "    * press \"esc\" to get out of the interior of the cell (go from edit to command mode)\n",
    "    * press \"x\" to delete that temporary cell\n",
    "    \n",
    "This may seem like a lot of steps, but once you memorize the shortcuts, you can rapidly create, use and delete cells. When you have an error, this is best way to quickly isolate parts of the code to test them.\n",

    "\n",
    "As you learned in the previous course material, Python comes with a large number of extremely useful libraries. In fact, Python itself is a rather small language on its own; it's true power is the myriad of libraries developed for it. A core library is [NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy), which translates to \"Numerical Python\". NumPy allows you to do mathematical operations both more easily (from a coding perspective) and faster (in the sense of how long you need to wait for the result). \n",

    "\n",
    "Why do we have the dot notation in which we will make calls to libraries with `np.`? The reason is that Python is huge and some of the libraries have overlapping functionalities. For example, the math module you already learned contains libraries that *also* exist in NumPy. By using the dot notation, you can be sure you are using the library of _your_ choice, and _you_ are free to switch between `math` and `np` throughout your code. Sometimes you will use dots _twice_, as in `np.random.randn(500)`.\n",
