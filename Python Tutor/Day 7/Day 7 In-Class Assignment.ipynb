    "## Exploring data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will embark on our first major **data science** project. We will primarly use Pandas for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set we will use is real; it comes from the Flint water crisis that first made the news in 2014, just down the road from where we are. In fact, it was only in April of 2018 that the Governor of Michigan stated that lead levels had returned to the federal safety limits. However, Flint still has many lead service lines that still need to be replaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will analyze the data ourselves and come up with conclusions and policy decisions based on what we find. The data is real, so it will be imperfect. It is important to learn to handle real-world data. The process of doing real data science typically follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inspecting**: you should *always* look at your data before you attempt to do anything. If you are using Pandas you can simply look at your dataframe using shift-enter in a cell with the name of the dataframe; Pandas will nicely format that to look like a spreadsheet.\n",
    "2. **Cleaning**: you will probably find problems in your data set, such as missing values or values that don't make sense. You will need to remove those from the data set, and you can use Pandas operations for removing rows and/or columns. \n",
    "3. **Transforming**: it is likely that the data has come to you in some form that you can't immediately use and you will need to transform it in some way. The transformation is very problem dependent, but might include changing the units (e.g., multiplying a column by a conversation factor), creating a new quantity from others (e.g., adding two columns together to create a new column) or removing cases that aren't of interest (e.g., grouping by a specific feature). \n",
    "4. **Modeling**: finally you can get to the fun part - thinking about what your data is telling you! There are too many techniques for data modeling to list here, but you have already seen one example: looking for correlations in the Great Lake levels by plotting the depth of one lake versus another.\n"

    "## Creating subsets of data: Pandas dataframe manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many datasets come with much more than you need for your goal; it's often useful to get some subset of data in a Pandas data frame.  Typical situations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* you want all rows in the data frame where a particular quantity is above or below a certain value\n",
    "* you want a range of rows (rows 1-10, for example)\n",
    "* you only want one or two of the columns\n",
    "\n",
    "In general you then use this subset of the data for further analysis or visualization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we're going to load a dataset into a dataframe with Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in the following cells, we're going to walk you through a variety of ways of getting the data you want out of a Pandas data frame. **Take notice of the new import command for importing Pandas (which is different thatn Numpy's `np.loadtxt()`!**"

For example, if you want to find out which rows of the column \"Pb Bottle 1 (ppb) - First Draw\" have values greater than 20, you'd say:\n",

    "\n",
    "Python has many very nice ways to make plots, and you have already learned a lot of `matplotlib`. Today your group will use some of the built-in plotting capabilities in `pandas`. (Soon, we will also learn a data science plotting library called `seaborn`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has several built-in methods for creating plots, as [described here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html).  You can also use the matplotplib [pyplot](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html) methods to create plots using slices of pandas data frames.  It's often helpful to look at the [pyplot tutorial](http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html) and the [matplotlib visualization gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) for ideas of the types of plots you can make.  The gallery is particularly useful, since if you see a plot you like you can click on it to see the code used to create it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic type of plot you can make with Pandas is a scatter plot, where you explicitly tell Pandas which quantities are the x and y axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    flint_data.plot.scatter(x='Ward',y='Pb Bottle 1 (ppb) - First Draw')\n",
    "    \n",

    "                            \n",
    "Note that the syntax is different here!  You have to use a data frame for the size of the points, because it needs a list of quantities.  \n",

    "\n",
    "    flint_data['Pb Bottle 1 (ppb) - First Draw'].plot.hist()\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that Pandas actually uses matplotlib and pyplot, so it's possible to use all of the matplotlib histogram functionality that is shown in the [pyplot histogram documentation](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.hist).  So, for example, you can change the number of bins, the upper and lower range of the bins, and many other things. Here's how you might make a cumulative histogram with 20 bins:\n",

    "    flint_data['Pb Bottle 1 (ppb) - First Draw'].plot.hist(bins=20, cumulative=True)\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Try out these examples below, and vary some of the parameters**. Discuss with your group members what each command is doing. **Add comments to the code to show you understand each line**. One of the powerful, but initially confusing, features of `pandas` is that you can chain a bunch of operations together - make sure you talk through any of the multistep commands that you might not fully understand and put them into English in your comments. For example: get a dataframe, find a specific column, make a plot of that and make that plot a histogram. Pandas has a way of compressing a lot of steps into one line."
