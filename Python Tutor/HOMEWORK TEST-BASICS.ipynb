    "## Question 4: Calculating Half Life Decay (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been observed that some substances undergo exponential decay, some examples of which include radioactive substances and drugs in the body. This has led to the definition of the \"half-life\", which is the time at which half of the original amount of the substance still remains. The equation that relates the half-life to the exponential decay is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ N(t) = N_0 \\big(\\frac{1}{2}\\big)^{\\frac{t}{t_{1/2}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If a person initially ingests 1500 milligrams (mg) of a drug ($N_0$) and the half life ($t_{1/2}$) of that drug is 12 hours, when does the amount of the drug in their body drop to 10% of the original dose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to write a __*while loop*__ to approximate __*when*__ (in hours) the amount the person ingested drops to 10% of its original value. Include a **print statement** that states how much time has to pass for the amount of the drug to drop to 10% of its original value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The substance decays. You need to loop from when `t=0` (where the substance is at maximum amount; N=N_0), and go to `t=1`, `t=2`, `t=3`, and so on. Stops once N < N_0 * 0.10. You can also approximate better by looping with half-hour like so `t=0.5`, `t=1`, `t=1.5`, and so on"
