You may have noticed that we've actually already been using one module quite regularly, the <code>YouTubeVideo</code> module.\n",

    "The cell below contains **four** lists of data, which correspond to two sets of X and Y values.  Use matplotlib to make a plot of these datasets. Make your plot with the following guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first pair of lists (x1, y1) should be drawn with a ***thick*, blue, dashed line**.\n",
    "* The second pair of lists (x2, y2) should be drawn with **red diamonds**.\n",
    "* Make the width of the plot extend from 0 to 20 and height of the plot extend from 6 to 16. This will help make the image bit easier to see.\n",
    "* Add axis labels to the x and y axes, with whatever text you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the [Pyplot Tutorial](http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html) for inspiration, and in particular you can find instructions on how to create different types of characters and line types in the [pyplot 'plot' command documentation](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: It is important to remember that any time you need a module, you **need to import it**. A good coding practice is to put all of your import commands at the top of your code block. Try to get into the habit of always importing the modules you are going to need **first**, before writing the rest of your code. If you realize you need another module, add it to your list at the top, don't just insert it into the body of the code randomly.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Question 3**: Now that you've been able to plot some functions that _look_ like sine and cosine, we want to make them look __more__ like sine and cosine by calculating more data points for our curves. One way of doing this is to create a list of values that we will pass to the sine or cosine function. We created a list called `x1` for you that you used for the plots you made above, but it didn't have enough values to make the curves look very smooth (we fired the person that made that list).\n",

Then plot cosine and sine over this interval with the same axis labels and colors as the plot you made above. \n",

    "**Hint**: To create your list, consider using a while-loop, that stops once the increment has surpassed $2\\pi$. The while-loop should  _append_ new values to `x_list`, starting at 0 and adding 0.1, appending that to the list, then adding 0.1 to the previous value, appending that value to the list, and so on. We will see other methods of creating lists like this in the future by some other very helpful modules. (Please do not hard code the values of your list by hand, use loops.)"
